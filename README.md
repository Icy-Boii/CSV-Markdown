# CSV-Markdown
To run this tool you first need to install the following: 
pip3 install pandas

To run the tool, type: 
python3 csv-markdown.py 

The tool will ask for the location of the CSV file you would like to convert to Markdown, This works best if the CSV file is in the same directory as the tool. 

This tool is used to convert CSV files into markdown formatting for SPV2 reports, the best example for the use of this tool is MDM reviews, the questionnaire can be converted to a numbers doc, then exported as .CSV, once filled out, and the tool will convert your MDM review into Markdown. 

Please note, the text in the CSV file has to be on the same line for it to convert to Markdown correctly. Examples of these can be found in MDM-Numbers.zip. (Please note these docs need to be exported to .CSV first). 

The tool will then output the file to a text doc called Markdown.txt
