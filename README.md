# CSV-Markdown
To run this tool you first need to install the following: 
pip3 install pandas

Run by typing: 
python3 csv-markdown.py 

The tool will ask for the location of the CSV file you would like to convert to Markdown, This works best if the CSV file is in the same directory as the tool. 

This tool is used to convert CSV files into markdown formatting. 

Please note, that the text in the CSV file has to be on the same line for it to convert to Markdown correctly. 

The tool will then output the file to a text doc called Markdown.txt
